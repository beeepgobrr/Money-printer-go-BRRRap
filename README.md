This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### ⚠️ Prerequisite

`FONTAWESOME_TOKEN` must be set as an environment variable or replaced in [.npmrc](.npmrc) to a valid [Font Awesome 5 Pro](https://fontawesome.com/pro) npm token. If you don't have or wish to pay for a Font Awesome license, you can substitute Pro icons such as `faMusicSlash` with free counterparts and replace the `@fortawesome/pro-solid-svg-icons` dependency with `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`.

---

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
